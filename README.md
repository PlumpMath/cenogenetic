CENOGENETIC

This is a high performance genetic algorithm library I wrote several months ago to get hip to the new c++x11 features.

It works well and fast, but I have fallen completely out of love with imperative/OO programming and won't be documenting or updating it. I'd be happy to offer assistance to anyone who wants to use or understand it.

I wrote it while reading [A Field Guide to Genetic Programming](http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/) (which is very recommended) and illustrates many of the ideas therein.

The lib uses a nucleotide/chromosome/locus/genome extended metaphor, which may be perceived as either helpful or overly precious and twee.

There is a nifty use of new c++ to allow generated functions of arbitrary arity, that goes beyond the book.

I'm not announcing this anywhere so I'm just typing for myself and will stop now.
